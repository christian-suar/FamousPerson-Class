"""
Create a FamousPerson class with:
Attributes: name, birth_year, country_of_birth
Method: introduce()
Example format: [name] was born in [birth_year] in [country_of_birth]
Create subclasses:
Scientist (adds field, notable_discovery)
Politician (adds position, years_in_office)
NOTE: you will need a new introduce() for each subclass so the printed statement will include the additional information for each.
Create instances for Albert Einstein,  Lebron James, and Abraham Lincoln, then call introduce() for each of them. 
Remember to use the correct class or subclass when you create these famouse people.
